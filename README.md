# Photonic Transformer with Micro Ring Resonators

## Overview
This repository contains a model of a transformer architecture built using a photonic core based on micro ring resonators. The photonic core enables matrix multiplication where weights are encoded as voltage inputs to micro ring modulators.

## Files
- `micro_ring_resonator.py`: Model of a micro ring resonator.
- `photonic_core.py`: Implementation of a photonic core for matrix multiplication.
- `photonic_transformer.py`: Transformer model using the photonic core.
- `train_transformer.py`: Script for training the transformer and finding the weight voltages.
- `calculate_power.py`: Script for calculating the power of the entire transformer architecture.
- `plot_results.py`: Script to plot the input and output of micro ring modulators.
